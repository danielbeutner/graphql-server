# graphql server

based on express and apollo! No it is running... It's true... Believe me... It's huge.

`npm i` and `npm run start` to run the thing

Routes:

- graphQL itself:   http://localhost:8080/graphql
- GUI for graphQL:  http://localhost:8080/graphiql
- Print the schema: http://localhost:8080/schema
- Check health:     http://localhost:8080/health

Changelog:

- Adds example from apollo (http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/generate-schema.html)
